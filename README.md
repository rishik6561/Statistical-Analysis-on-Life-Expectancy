Statistical Analysis on Life Expectancy

Overview
Welcome to my project on Statistical Analysis of Life Expectancy. In this project, I have conducted an in-depth statistical analysis to explore factors influencing life expectancy across different countries. The analysis involved cleaning and preprocessing the data, performing various feature selection techniques, hypothesis testing, and evaluating model performance to derive actionable insights and recommendations for improving life expectancy.

Key Features
Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: The data was cleaned and preprocessed to ensure consistency and accuracy in the analysis.
Feature Selection Techniques: Various feature selection methods such as jackknife residuals, cook's distance, and forward selection were applied using RStudio to identify the most important features influencing life expectancy.
Hypothesis Testing: Extensive hypothesis testing was conducted to identify areas for improvement in increasing life expectancy.
Model Performance Analysis: The performance of the statistical model was analyzed to understand the key factors affecting life expectancy and to present recommendations for improvement.

Project Structure
Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Cleaning and preprocessing of the data to ensure data quality.
Feature Selection: Application of feature selection techniques to identify important features.
Hypothesis Testing: Conducting hypothesis tests to explore factors affecting life expectancy.
Model Performance Analysis: Evaluating the performance of the statistical model and deriving insights.
Conclusion
This project showcases my proficiency in statistical analysis and my ability to derive meaningful insights from data to address real-world challenges. By analyzing factors influencing life expectancy, I have presented recommendations for improving life expectancy in different countries. I believe that the findings of this analysis can contribute to efforts aimed at enhancing public health and well-being.
